### Project Description

Develop an application for booking clinic appointments. The service should be an aggregator for city clinics and support user registration. During registration, the nearest clinic (for children and adults) is determined, or the user can select a clinic from a list. 

The application should also provide a list of city hospitals and their departments, including their specializations. For clinics, ensure the ability to book an appointment with a pediatrician/therapist or a specialist, as well as the option to cancel or reschedule the appointment. 

Registration data can be stored locally or an external service can be used. Additional functionality is welcome. Data should be stored in an SQLite database. Use UserDefaults (NSUserDefaults) or plist.
